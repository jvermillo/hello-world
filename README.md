### A test project for practicing the Github flow

Hello! This is me, Juniper Vermillo, a college student who is aspiring to work in the tech industry. I am passionate with various types of software and how they work. For example, I get fascinated reading or watching how an application is designed or how the developers have made it reliable for the end user.

Besides that, I am also passionate with Japanese music (my favorite album is "CAN! CAN! CAN!" by Cosmos), hardware, and cats.
